        **Rules**
If paint texture is supplied then that is effected by color only, otherwise full diffuse is multiplied by color.
Color filters are used for highlighting things, all diffuse and speculate output is multiplied by this.

        **Render Pattern**
1. Solid geometry: diffuse, depth, normal, shine+filter
2. Transparency layer modified by geometry depth: transdiffuse, transdepth, transnormals, transshine+filter
4. Geometry specular overlay using normal and shine+filter drawn over geometry diffuse: diffuse
5. Transparency specular using transnormal and transshine drawn over transdiffuse: transdiffuse
7. Final render using all diffuse and depth buffers rendering particles based on them: screen

Buffer Types:
    diffuse = RGB
    transdiffuse = RGBA
    shine+filter = RGBA (shine is the alpha)

Stats
    Shader count: 10
    Transparency: Not perfect, but fast. No sorting.


        **Collision**
Octree:
    Each block has 4x4x4 small blocks if not solid or empty.
    Use bit checking.
